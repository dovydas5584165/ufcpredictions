The current model uses GPTBOOST to predict fight outcomes. It is trained on a dataset containing all past ufc fights with fighter statistics. The accuracy is around 76 %.
Model accounts for physical traits and better skills but I am still unsure if the model makes sense and how to capture 'character' because there is tonnes of unathletic fighters
who manage to win fights by pure heart.
